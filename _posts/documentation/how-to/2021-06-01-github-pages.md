## Introduction
This section describes how to add or edit pages for this design system using GitHub pages.

## Before you start
There are a couple of required steps to be able to collaborate on this content:

1. Have an existing or create a GitHub account.
2. Be a part of the COINS Design System Repository.

3. Follow the instructions described on this page or the [Design System Cheatsheet](../cheatsheet/). 


## Editing existing pages

At the bottom of every page there is a "Edit on GitHub" button.

Clicking on this button navigates you to an appropriate GitHub page in a new browser tab. On this page there's an edit action (see screenshot below) in the top right corner of the screen.

This action will switch the page mode to editing. For the appropriate content markdown please refer to [Design System Cheatsheet](../cheatsheet/).


## Creating new pages

To create a new page navigate to [this page](https://github.com/COINS-GLOBAL/coins-design-system/tree/design-system/_posts){:target="_blank"}, to an appropriate folder and click the "Add File" button and choose "Create new file" option from the menu (see screenshot below).

### Naming the pages
For a page to appear in the list of pages, it has to have a correct format file name which is <span class="snip">yyyy-mm-dd-nameofpage.md</span>

### Standard page template
There's a certain template we need to follow at the start of the page.

This section describes the page settings such as title, description, relation to different sections, categories and subsections of the design system and the page URL.
