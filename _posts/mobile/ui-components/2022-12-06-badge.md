## Overview
Badges have a lot of variations that depend on their function. They can include text, numbers, or icons. The color of the badge can be changed.

## Component Variations
Each badge has a particular function and its design signals that function to the user via text and color. It is therefore very important that the different variants are implemented consistently across products, so that they message the correct information.

The recommended colors for state indicating are red for something terminated, failed, or discarded, yellow as warning state, green for approved, checked, completed, grey for a draft or unfinished.
All colors should be taken from Coins Mobile Color Palette.
