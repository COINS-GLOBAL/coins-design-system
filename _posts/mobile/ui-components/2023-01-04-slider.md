## Overview
Slider component consists of two parts which are interdependent: slider input(s) and slider track itself. User can interact with slider in two ways: either by typing the value into slider input(s) field or by dragging the slider knob(s) along slider track. When interacting with a slider (dragging slider knob(s) left or right), the slider input should immediately indicate the value the slider is changing. 
And vice versa: when you input the value into slider input(s) field, the slider should be changed accordingly.

## Component Variations
There are two types of slider view: range selection and value selection.

### Range selection

Range selection is used when user needs to state start and end point for a range of values. Range selection has two input fields for entering the range values, as well as two knobs. If user inputs the value of range end point less than start point, the input should return an error such as “Range start point can not be bigger than the end point” or the other wording which is more appropriate for a certain use case.
And vice versa: if the start point value is bigger than end point value, again return an error to the field.

If user tries to move start point knob far to the right and it overlaps end point, ui should not allow this gesture and block moving it further to the right. The same with end point - it can not be moved more far to the left than the start point. 

Both start and end point values should lie between given restrictions, which are stated below the slider track (in this example restrictions are 0 sec and 60 sec).
If user inputs value which is bigger than stated slider restrictions, UI should return an error.

### Value selection

Value selection is used when the user needs to state a single value. This value should lie between given restrictions, which are stated below the slider track (in this example restrictions are 0 sec and 60 sec).
If user inputs value which is bigger than stated slider restrictions, UI should return an error.
