## Overview
We support all devices starting from width resolution 320pt and higher (ex.: iPhone 5).
All spacing should be in multiples of 4 on all platforms.

Main elements of the layout are:
1. Top Navigation Bar. Is used mostly for navigation purposes. Is located at the upper elevation level (above othe elements). Has fixed position when scrolling
2. Content area. The content area is used for displaying most of the content in an app. It typically contains components such as lists, cards, buttons, and images. The height of content area can be reduced if more elements are added to the top bar - such as search, tabs, etc. And the size can be increased if the action bar does not exist.
3. Action bar. The place for action button(s). Action bar can be hidden in case there are no main actions to perform on the screen (for ex. view mode, empt state, etc.)
As Top bar, action bar is located at the upper elevation level (above othe elements). Has fixed position when scrolling.
