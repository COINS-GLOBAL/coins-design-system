## Overview

Avatars can be used to represent people or objects. It supports images, icons, or letters. Users generally upload their own image, otherwise, a default image is displayed.

Use an avatar to help a user efficiently identify another person or an organization. The Avatar also can be used to provide navigation to a user's profile, or to associate a user with a particular set of data. 

## Component Variations
### Size
Avatars in mobile design system are represented in 2 main sizes: 60 * 60 and 40 * 40.

### Appearance
It is preferable that an avatar display an image, which is is usually uploaded by a user. Images are personalized and make good use of the ability of the human brain to recognize faces. Project and group avatars contain a fallback in the case an image is not provided: 

**Avatar with initials**

When there is no personal photo to show, use initials. If the label name contains two words, like first and last name, the first letter of each will be capitalized and returned - for example, JD for Jane Doe

**Avatar with Icon**

When there is no specific individual or group identified, use the default user avatar with icon.
