### Examples of positioning
The positioning of the empty state should always be in the center of the content area. Let's take a look at common cases of Empty state usage:

**Case 1.** Search bar does not exist, empty state is located in the middle of highlighted Content area. Distance from the top and bottom ends of the content area (here distance X) is the same.

**Case 2.** Search bar exists, empty state is located in the middle of highlighted Content area. Content area becomes smaller because of the search bar. Distance from the top and bottom ends of the content area (here distance X) is the same.

**Case 3.** Example of empty state appearance without button. Empty state is located in the middle of highlighted Content area. Distance from the top and bottom ends of the content area (here distance X) is the same. Empty state takes less space as the button does not exist.
