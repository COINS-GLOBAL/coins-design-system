## Toast messages
These notifications usually are feedback for the user's previous activity within the app. Users can apply actions to these notifications such as close, undo, etc

Action required notifications appear at the bottom of the screen: if action buttons exist, then notification should be 12px above the buttons; if there are no buttons, then notification should be located 12px from the bottom of the screen.
