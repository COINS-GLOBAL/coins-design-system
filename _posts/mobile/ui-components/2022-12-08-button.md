## Overview

Buttons are tappable elements that are used to trigger actions. They communicate calls to action to the user and allow users to interact with pages in a variety of ways. Button labels express what action will occur when the user interacts with it.

## Component Variations
### Primary
Primary buttons communicate main actions that users can take on the screen.

**Example of usage**

The primary buttons are usually used in an action panel. If the interface requires one main action, then standard button takes the whole screen with 12 px paddings from left and right (see example 1)

If there are two main actions then we use two buttons located in action panel with 12 px paddings from left and right 8 px spacing between them. (see example 2)

The action panel has shadow to divide the action panel from other content. Shadow style can be reviewed via Figma export tool.

### Ghost
Button presented with a piece of text and isnâ€™t integrated into any shape. Can be used with or without the icon depending on the UX you want to build.
