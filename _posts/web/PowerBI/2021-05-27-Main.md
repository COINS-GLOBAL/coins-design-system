## Overview

We use power BI charts in different parts of OA to show a vide veriety of data points using simple charts, graphs and tables. To work with Power BI you need a computer running on Windows. Power BI doesn't support Mac devices and only allows you to view and present published reports via https://app.powerbi.com/

## Guidelines
###Colors
For designing Power BI report we use colors from Coins Global styling and Colors from OA design system.

### Indicating the state
When we need to show the difference between different trend states, we use three main colors as indicators: <br>
- Red #F18078 for critical state
- Amber #EABF5B for warnings
- Green #7CC144 for good state
