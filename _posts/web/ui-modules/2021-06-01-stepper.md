## Overview
Wizzard Stepper is a UI module which helps display the amount of required steps a user has to go through while working with a task while providing their status indicators (colored dots).

### When to use
We should use this module if the task at hand can be completed withing one user session.

### When not to use
We should NOT use this module if a time to complete a task requires more then one user session or when the task is dependent on multiple users. In case a the task is a lengthy process requiring multiple users and we need to display status of each process step, use the [Timeline module](../timeline/).

| Variation | Class                                | Usage          |
|-----------|--------------------------------------|----------------|
| Default   | –                                    | Standard "Pending" type step. Not clickable unless previous steps have been filled in. |
| Current   | <span class="snip">current</span>    | The "Current" step. If a step just became current - it's indicator becomes yellow. Can overlap with a complete or error steps by using both classes (i.e. when a user clicks back and lands at a previously complete step - green, the indicator stays green but the background changes.) |
| Complete  | <span class="snip">complete</span>   | A complete step showing a green indicator. This variant is shown for previous steps which passed their validation successfully. |
| w/ Error  | <span class="snip">error</span>      | A step showing a red indicator due to validation errors. |

## Behavior
By default, when a user lands on a screen or modal window containing this module, the first step would be marked as <span class="snip">current</span>. Other steps are not intractable unless the previous step has been complete and validated.

Users CAN'T navigate forward through steps by clicking on this modules items. Instead a "continue" button (or something of this sort) should be present on each step up to the final one. This button should launch the validation process and either navigate onto the next step or stop and show errors. If the validation was a success – the now previous step is marked as <span class="snip">complete</span> and the user is navigated to the next step which is now marked as <span class="snip">current</span>. 

Users CAN navigate back through steps if the previous steps have been completed and marked as <span class="snip">complete</span>. 


### Steps dependency
If a user goes to previous steps and tries changing data which affects data on the next steps, a popup message should appear warning the user that they are about to undo the next steps data progress.
