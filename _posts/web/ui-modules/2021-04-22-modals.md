## Overview

Modal Windows present a short-term task the user needs to perform. This can include critical or warning information where a response is required, however they’re also intended to support efficient task completion without losing the context of the underlying page. Users won't be able to interact with the page until the dialog is closed.

In some cases, modals may contain information that requires additional help and support. Elements, such as filters or hint text, can be added to the modal dialog to help users respond with clarity and efficiency at the expense of dialog real estate.

### When to use
- Require an immediate response from the user

Use a dialog to request information that is preventing the system from continuing a user-initiated process.

- Notify the user of urgent information

Use a modal dialog to notify the user of urgent information concerning their current work. Modal dialogs are commonly used to report system errors or convey a consequence of a user’s action.

- Confirm a user decision

Use a modal dialog to confirm user decisions. Clearly describe the action being confirmed and explain any potential consequences that it may cause. Both the title and the button should reflect the action that will occur. If the action is destructive or irreversible then use a transactional danger modal.

### When not to use
- For nonessential information that is not related to the current workflow.

- When the modal requires additional information for decision making that is unavailable in the modal itself.

- Avoid modal over modal. It can confuse user about the context.

## Guidelines

Modal Windows are always fixed to the same spot in the middle of the sceen and can respond appropriately to screen size. They are composed of 3 elements: 
1. Header: Contains the modal title. 

Modal dialog titles should use sentence case and prioritize keywords.
2. Body: Provides an overview of the modal's purpose and, optionally, controls to complete a task. 

Modal dialog body copy should contain only valuable and relevant information or input fileds that are both helpful and concise.
3. Footer: Contains a primary action and the ability to cancel and close the dialog. 

The main action (a primary button) should reflect the modal title. For example, a modal with the title "Select a template" has a button labeled "Select". If a secondary terminal action is needed, it should go between the primary button and cancel button, styled as a secondary button.
