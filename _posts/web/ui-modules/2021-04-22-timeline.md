## Overview
A timeline displays a series of events which can guide the user through processes or pre-defined steps while also showing current progress.

Timeline sets an expectation for the whole process by breaking it up into concrete steps and a pre-determined goal. It shows the user their progress along the steps of the timeline with a current step. For all of the steps, a timeline provides information such as a header (step title), timestamp, orange check icon to show completed steps, orange circle to represent the current step, grey ones to represent future steps.

### When to use
- For workflows with complex steps, when a time to complete a task requires more then one user session or when the task is dependent on multiple users.
- When a series of information needs to be ordered by time (ascending or descending).
- When you need a timeline to make a visual connection.
- When the user needs clear progress indication.

### When not to use
We should NOT use this module if the task at hand can be completed withing one user session. In this case consieder using [Wizard Stepper module](../wizard-stepper/).

## Guidelines
As users move through the timeline steps should be progressively marked with the current and success icons to indicate progress:
- By default, step one is highlighted as the current step.
- When step one is complete the step two gets highlighted, step one becomes orange check icon, when steps one and two are complete (looking as orange check icons), step three gets highlighted, etc.
- When the user has completed all steps, they are all marked complete.
- The Timeline is usually placed at the top of the viewport.
